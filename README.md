## ✨ What is this?

**HeartSploit** is a romantic hacking toolkit — a *love letter disguised as code*, a collection of sweet scripts and simulated attacks designed not to break systems... but to melt hearts.

## 💌 What's Inside?

| Tool         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `HeartCracker` | A bash script that simulates a WPA2 brute-force attack — but the only handshake it captures is your crush’s. |
| *(more coming soon)* | Sweet exploits, fake captures, romantic payloads, crafted with terminal passion. |

<br>

## 🖤 Why?

Because love, like hacking, is about curiosity.
About persistence.
About finding the right key… to unlock someone’s heart.
